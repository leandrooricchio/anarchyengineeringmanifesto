The Anarchy R&D Manifesto: Empowering the Builders

Autonomous Execution: Given a clear, singular goal, engineering teams have the absolute authority to determine the "how," "what," and "when" of its realization.

Tooling Self-Determination: Engineers choose the technologies, frameworks, and methodologies they deem most effective for achieving the stated goal.

Direct Responsibility: The engineering team that builds the solution is directly accountable for its quality, maintainability, and delivery.

Code-Centric Collaboration: Processes and meetings are self-organized and strictly limited to those actively contributing to the codebase for the current goal.

Iterative Discovery: Development proceeds through rapid experimentation and feedback loops, allowing for course correction based on tangible results.

Peer Collaboration: Knowledge sharing and problem-solving are driven by direct interaction and collaboration amongst the engineering team.

Metric-Driven Progress: Success is measured by the demonstrable achievement of the stated goal and relevant technical metrics defined by the team.

Ruthless Prioritization: Engineers collectively decide on the most impactful tasks to focus on to reach the single defined goal.

Continuous Improvement: Teams are empowered to retrospect and adapt their processes and tools based on their own experiences and learnings.

Goal-Oriented Freedom: The single-line goal provides the necessary direction, while all other aspects of execution are left to the expertise and judgment of the engineering team.

Unshackled Execution: These principles are merely suggestions. Engineers are ultimately unbound by them and empowered to disregard any principle, practice, or constraint if they believe it hinders the swift and effective achievement of the stated goal. Deliver the result, by any means necessary.
